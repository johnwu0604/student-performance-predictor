# Student Performance Predictor

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a simple example of how to integrate a machine learning model into a real-life application. In order to do so, this repository holds the source code for a flask application integrated with a feature to predict whether a student will pass or fail a course given a specific set of inputs.

This project is to be used for introductory workshops aimed at teaching the basics of integrating ML into a Flask App.
